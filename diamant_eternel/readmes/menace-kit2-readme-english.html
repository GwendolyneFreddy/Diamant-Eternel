				Menace sur le royaume de Diamant Éternel</strong> adds two new paladin kits: the <a href="menace-kit1-readme-english.html">Diamond Knight</a> and the Unicorn Rider.<br><br>
				I strongly recommend that you DO NOT select them when you generate your character in order to benefit from all the elements of the scenario: CHARNAME will be able to choose one of these specializations in the course of the adventure. Moreover, they have been specially designed to fit the universe of the Eternal Diamond Kingdom and match its mythology. Also, remember that their abilities will only be really useful during the campaign and may be a handicap during most of the SoA game.<br><br>
				However, if you absolutely want to play them from the beginning of your game, both provide a special quest in SoA that will be integrated in the final campaign.<br><br>
				At last, those kits may benefit from a special mount (a steed for the Knight and a unicorn for the Rider), whose name you will be able to define in <a href="menace-readme-english.html#installation">installation process</a>.<br>

				<td style="font-size: 90%; text-align:right; border:none"><img width=500 src="images/diamant3.jpg" title="Unicorn Rider"><br>Ted Welch DeviantArt &copy;2015-2017 St0rMiee.</td>

					Unicorn Riders are women who have forsworn the love of mortals to dedicate themselves entirely to the unicorn deity Lurue, thus fostering a close bond with unicorns. They normally come from the ranks of exalted rangers or druids, although there have been paladins and even fighters who have chosen this path. Most of Riders are humans, elves, and half-elves, but halflings, gnomes, and dwarves are not prohibited.<br><br>
					There are two ways for a paladin to become a Rider. The first occurs very rarely: having noticed her bravery, her righteousness and her behavior, Lurue comes to haunt the dreams of the fortunate chosen woman who, on waking up, finds a protective medallion on her heart. The latter will summon forth a unicorn that will serve her as a destrier and will fight at her side as long as she serves the right causes.<br><br>
					But, throughout her adventures, the paladine may also help a unicorn and even save it. Both the paladin and the unicorn may then decide to share their destinies. The ritual takes places in a forest chosen by the Elders and lasts for about a week, during which they get to know each other.<br><br>
					In any case, the relationship between the Rider and the unicorn can not be created if another strong relationship already binds one of them. The Rider must not have a familiar or paladin horse, and if she has had any, she must have been separated from it for at least one season (three months). As well, a unicorn must not have served another Rider, and if it has already done, their separation must be at least one season old. The Rider has a closer emotional bond to her mount than she does with her own family members. Just as she relies on the unicorn, the unicorn relies on her to help keep its mysteries safe.</td>

		<p>
			Since unicorns have devoted their lives to protecting their forests and their intelligent creatures, the Rider retreats to the woods and maintains few contacts with the outside world. Because of the solitary existence she must endure, it is rare (but not unheard of) for a Rider to join ranks with other adventurers, but she may leave her forest sanctuary should she be needed to fight evil. In such event, she prefers the companionship of paladins but can associate with any good characters when necessary. Under no circumstances will one Rider agree to join with evil beings, and she barely tolerates neutral characters, unless they are druids.<br><br>
			All Riders must be chaste and must dedicate themselves wholly both to good and their unicorn companions. Should a Rider ever willingly couple with a mortal, the unicorn leaves her company without hard feelings or regret. At last, it is easy to recognize a Rider with its immaculate white outfits and its long and free hair that quickly turn white or silvery.

The Rider can use a variant of the 7th-level druidic spell Nature"s Beauty once per day.<br>
				With this ability, the Rider appears to undergo a remarkable transformation and becomes the very ideal of beauty: For a male, this is usually a nymph; for a female, it varies. As with a nymph, all humanoids who look directly at her must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell or die of longing for the denied illusion. They suffer a Saving Throw penalty depending on their Hit Dice: if they have at least the same level as the Rider, they get a penalty of -1 increased by 1 every 10 levels of the Rider. If they have 5 Hit Dice less than her, they are automatically killed. Otherwise, they get a penalty of -4 increased by 1 every five levels of the Rider. Even if the Saving Throw is successful, they are all instantly smitten with permanent blindness (until dispelled).<br>
				The transformation is instantaneous, but lasts only seconds, affecting those within 60 feet of her (excluding fellow party members).<br>
				According to the legend, the Rider must abstain from sexual intercourse for one month before casting this spell, mais nobody has ever dared to check...</td>

Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. In addition, the unicorn seems to move floating 4 inches above the ground.

Thus it leaves no tracks (neither footprints nor scent) on any sort of ground, may not set off pressure traps, is immune to anything that might affect its movement, such as spider webs, Grease and Entangle spells.

				This spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Dispel Magic is above the original caster, his/her chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, his/her chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he/she is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he/she is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.<br>
				Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.</td>

Any affected creature who fails to save vs. Paralysis will continue to hear the siren ringing in his ears for the 1d4+1 rounds, with similar effects as a deafness spell.</li>
						<li>Revitalizor (30th level): The sword imbues the Rider with part of its energy, enabling her to regenerate 1 Hit Point per second as long as she wields it.</li>
						<li>Redeemer (35th level): The Magic Circle against Evil also causes all evil creatures within the area of effect to succumb to the effects of a fear spell if they fail a Saving Throw vs. Spells (with a -4 penalty).</li>
						<li>Purifier (40th level): The sword grants an extra +3 bonus to hit and damage against undead, and turns undead whose level is lesser or equal or to the paladin level.</li>

				At this level of mastery, the Rider does not need to lay her hand upon a living creature, but she has only to briefly focus on it to channel positive energy that cures 3d8 Hit Points +1 per caster level (up to a maximum of +15). Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just as any normal injury.<br>
				The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies or of extraplanar origin. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them rather than curing them. An affected undead creature may apply magic resistance, and roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell to halve damage.</td>

				This spell affords the paladin or the touched creature partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy Plane connections (such as vampires), and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy Plane, possibly offsetting the effects of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. The protected creature suffers only normal Hit Point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience.

				The Rider calls upon his/her deity to act as a bridge between her and the Prime Material Plane, causing a shock wave that releases magic of tremendous power centered on the paladin and reaching up to a 40-ft. radius.

				Fighting alongside a unicorn, while mostly riding it, requires the Rider to take precautions to make sure she will not accidentally wound her companion in battle. Ce sort fait partie de l'arsenal dont elle dispose à cet effet.

This weapon made of pure force can only be used by the Rider and remains in her hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled. It is light and easy to pull, so that she can use it without penalty for non-proficiency. It strikes as a magical spear with a +1 bonus for every 10 caster levels in terms of to hit and damage rolls bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal spear used when charging (2d6, plus the magical bonus), even if Rider does not ride her unicorn or a horse.<br>
