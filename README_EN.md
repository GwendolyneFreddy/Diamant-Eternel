<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 110%;line-height: 150%;"><strong>Menace sur le royaume de Diamant Éternel</strong> is a French mod designed to provide more than a huge quest, without being a total conversion. A tiny part takes place in BG2 Shadows of Amn, but the main part is played in the Throne of Bhaal extension.<br/><br/>
You liked Excalibur, did not you? But have you ever wondered why every woman character is treated as a pest? Guinevere adultery, Morgane the wicked... Why do Paladin Orders recrute only men?<br/><br/>
And what if those tales were nothing but a fable spread by men to hide the truth?<br/><br/>
This mod tries to restore the truth, at least ITS TRUTH...<br/><br/>
The adventure takes place in a parallel dimension, both 'near' and 'far away' from Faerûn, more precisely in the Kingdom of Eternal Diamond, ruled by a dynasty of paladin kings that a renegade paladin attempts to overthrow. To carry out her betrayal, she has made a pact with rather 'special evil forces'...<br/><br/>
The kingdom derives its wealth from its minings and its power from the protection of the silver dragon Diamantor, worshipped by some as a demigod.</p>
<p>
<em>Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to save the Kingdom of Eternal Diamond.</em>
</p>
<p>
Well, who would've guessed? Rather unusable, isn't it? &#128541;<br>
<p>
If you do, you will face a fearsome coalition bringing together an Order of treacherous and 'misguided' paladins, to say the least, a guild of kamikaze assassins and a company of wizard slayers (nasty business for those fond of arcanes...).
</p>
<p>But not only... You will also have to face a secret cult, The Fangs of Tiamat, and their fierce and powerful minions. It is up to you to choose the way to handle those encounters: the hard way (at your own risk), or a more subtle way.</p>
</p>
<p>Indeed I strove to give you as much as possible the opportunity to play this adventure and complete its quests without having to fight. But I prefer to warn you: the creatures you will encounter are terrifically powerful. So, please, don't come later to complain and whine about the consequences if you systematically prefer to challenge them and rush straight ahead without thinking. &#128521;

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong>setup-diamant_eternel.exe</strong> (or .command with OS X), uninstall all previously installed components and delete the <strong>diamant_eternel folder</strong>.</em>

<em>When installing or uninstalling, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

<em>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.</em></br>



#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.



#### &#9888;&#65039; Warning: installation process

###### Variables needed for installation are read from <em><a href="https://github.com/GwendolyneFreddy/Diamant-Eternel/master/diamant_eternel/diamant_eternel.ini">diamant_eternel.ini</a></em> file, or <em>diamant_eternel_user.ini</a></em> if it exists.

As interrupting installation with plain text prompts allowing players to customise components to their liking, those variables have been moved into <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GwendolyneFreddy/Diamant-Eternel/master/diamant_eternel/diamant_eternel.ini">diamant_eternel.ini</a> file in <strong>diamant_eternel</strong> folder. This file provides a '<em>standard</em>' installation.

If you want to define your own customized installation, you have to modify the variables involved in <strong><em>diamant_eternel.ini</em></strong>, then save this file as <strong><em>diamant_eternel_user.ini</em></strong>.

The installation process will read both ini files and prioritize user values. If a value is not set or mismatched in diamant_eternel_user.ini, any installation failure will be prevented by reverting it back to its default value.</br>

Here is a chart listing the variables related to the installation process:<br>
