## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

<center><img src="diamant_eternel/readmes/images/diamant1.jpg" title="Menace sur le Royaume de Diamant Éternel"></center>
<p style="font-size: 80%;text-align:right;margin-right: 40px">Lux et Umbra by Chaos-Draco DeviantArt &copy;2009-2018 Chaos-Draco</p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 110%;line-height: 150%;">**Menace sur le royaume de Diamant Éternel** is a French mod designed to provide more than a huge quest, without being a total conversion. A tiny part takes place in BG2 Shadows of Amn, but the main part is played in the Throne of Bhaal extension.<br><br>
You liked Excalibur, did not you? But have you ever wondered why every woman character is treated as a pest? Guinevere adultery, Morgane the wicked... Why do Paladin Orders recrute only men?<br><br>
And what if those tales were nothing but a fable spread by men to hide the truth?<br><br>
This mod tries to restore the truth, at least *ITS TRUTH*...<br><br>
The adventure takes place in a parallel dimension, both 'near' and 'far away' from Faerûn, more precisely in the Kingdom of Eternal Diamond, ruled by a dynasty of paladin kings that a renegade paladin attempts to overthrow. To carry out her betrayal, she has made a pact with rather 'special evil forces'...<br><br>
The kingdom derives its wealth from its minings and its power from the protection of the silver dragon Diamantor, worshipped by some as a demigod.</p>

*Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to save the Kingdom of Eternal Diamond.*


Well, who would've guessed? Rather unusable, isn't it? &#128541;

If you do, you will face a fearsome coalition bringing together an Order of treacherous and 'misguided' paladins, to say the least, a guild of kamikaze assassins and a company of wizard slayers (nasty business for those fond of arcanes...).


But not only... You will also have to face a secret cult, The Fangs of Tiamat, and their fierce and powerful minions. It is up to you to choose the way to handle those encounters: the hard way (at your own risk), or a more subtle way.

Indeed I strove to give you as much as possible the opportunity to play this adventure and complete its quests without having to fight. But I prefer to warn you: the creatures you will encounter are terrifically powerful. So, please, don't come later to complain and whine about the consequences if you systematically prefer to challenge them and rush straight ahead without thinking. &#128521;<br>

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

Menace sur le Royaume de Damant Éternel is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. [facultatif : It has been tested on several different installations, and has so far worked perfectly.] However, we cannot test every single one. [Choisir une formule parmi les suivantes :] If you do encounter any bugs, please contact <a href="https://www.baldursgateworld.fr/lacouronne/Auteur.html">AUTHOR</a> or alternatively post on the forums. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!

Though I am striving to make it compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:
- Kit Revisions: as this mod modifies les capacités spéciales des kits originaux du jeu, il est par conséquent incompatible avec tous les mods utilisant la définition initiale de ces capacités.
- mod 2
- ...

#### Insttallation Order

Classical games players are strongly recommended to also download and install the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> and <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/871-bg2tob-throne-of-bhaal-extender/">Throne of Bhaal Extender</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

Moreover, Menace sur le Royaume de Diamant Éternel has been specifically designed to make the best use of the modding opportunities provided by the graphical mods <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/category/98-infinity-animations/">Infinity Animations</a> and <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/category/29-1pp/">One Pixel Productions</a>. Installation process will be aborted if they are not detected.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-diamant_eternel.exe`__ (or .command with OS X), un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: __diamant_eternel__ folder and __setup-diamant_eternel.exe__ file.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Menace sur le Royaume de Diamant Éternel for Windows is distributed as a compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: diamant_eternel folder and a setup-diamant_eternel.exe file in your game folder. To install, double-click **`setup-diamant_eternel.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-diamant_eternel.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

:warning: Unfortunately, this mod is not currently fully compatible with OS X because a few components patching exe file do not support OS X. If you wish to make it so, please post your interest in the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/159-1pp/">forum</a>. (It may help to examine your game launcher and the contents of the existing patch in an editor if you have any technical expertise.)

However, since EE games don't need to be patched to benefit from Infinity Animations, Menace sur le Royaume de Diamant Éternel can be installed on Mac OS X EE games.

Menace sur le Royaume de Diamant Éternel for EE and for Mac OS X is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: diamant_eternel folder, setup-diamant_eternel and setup-diamant_eternel.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-diamant_eternel.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-diamant_eternel.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Menace sur le Royaume de Diamant Éternelfor Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu, weinstall and tolower to `/usr/local/bin` (create it if needed). Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run **`/usr/local/bin/tolower`** and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, type **`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`**, then run **`weinstall setup-diamant_eternel`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-diamant_eternel --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.

## 

#### <a name="config" id="config">&#9888;&#65039; Warning: installation process

###### Options needed for installation are read from *<a href="../diamant_eternel-config-default.ini">diamant_eternel-config-default.ini</a>* file, or *diamant_eternel-config-user.ini* if it exists.

As interrupting installation with plain text prompts allowing players to customise components to their liking is not compatible with most mods managers, all those options have been moved into <a href="../diamant_eternel-config-default.ini">diamant_eternel-config-default.ini</a> file in :file_folder: **diamant_eternel** folder. This file provides a '*default*' installation.

If you want to define your own customized installation, you have to edit **_diamant_eternel-config-default.ini_** with Notepad or another text editor, then save it as *__diamant_eternel-config-user.ini__*.

Each line consists of a configuration option, then '=', then a number or an alphanumeric character string. The only thing you should edit is the number or the string.

The installation process will read both .ini files and prioritize user's options values. If a value is not set or mismatched in diamant_eternel-config-user.ini, any installation failure will be prevented by reverting it back to its default value.<br>

Here is a chart listing options related to the installation process:<br><br>

| Option | Install Option Description | Type | Values | Default |
| :---: | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| gw_unicorn_name  | The name of your unicorn, if any | string | a name! ! | <strong>Flèche d'argent<strong> |
| gw_destrier_name | The name of your paladin steed, if any | alphanumérique | a name! ! | <strong>Black Diamond<strong> |
| gw_language_bam  | Définit la langue dans laquelle vous souhaitez installer les fichiers BAM d'information :<br>AUTO = Installation language<br>FR = French<br>US = English<br>DE = FGerman<br>IT = Italian<br>RU = Russian<br>SP = Spanish | string | AUTO, FR, US, DE, IT, RU ou SP | <strong>AUTO<strong> |
| gw_mos_mosaic    | todo | string | 0 or 1 | <strong>1<strong> |
